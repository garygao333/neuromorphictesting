Sending and receiving data from Arduino using Pyserial library. 

## Setup

Here are the steps to run this project

### a. Open test_comms.ino and open files Comms.h and Comms.cpp

Make sure that you're connected to an arduino (I used UNO). Then upload the code. 

### b. Open Test_Comms.ipynb. Input the correct seiral port. 

You can find the serial port for Mac with the terminal command below. 
```
ls /dev/tty.*
```
Then run everything.
